# Asymptora: Data Engineering P&D Lab

### Building Production-Grade Data Platforms on Azure & AWS.

---

## Our Mission

Asymptora is an advanced engineering lab dedicated to designing, implementing, and documenting enterprise-grade, cloud-native data solutions. Our core philosophy is that true expertise is demonstrated by building robust, scalable, and automated systems from first principles. We don't just use platforms; we engineer them.

## Our Expertise: A Dual-Cloud Approach

We operate on a multi-cloud model with dedicated, deep specialization, allowing us to architect the best solution for the problem, not just for a single cloud.

* ### üî∑ **Azure Practice (Lead: Higor Cazuza)**
    Focus on leveraging the full power of the Azure data ecosystem‚Äîfrom Data Lake Storage and Databricks to Azure Synapse‚Äîto build end-to-end analytical platforms, all provisioned and managed via Terraform.

* ### üî∂ **AWS Practice (Lead: Jana√≠na Cazuza)**
    Focus on architecting scalable and cost-efficient data solutions using the AWS stack, including services like S3, Glue, Lambda, and Redshift, automated through the AWS CDK and Terraform.

This dual-specialist model enables deep cross-training and ensures our solutions are built on a foundation of diverse, best-in-class architectural patterns.
