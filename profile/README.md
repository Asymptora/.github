# Asymptora: A Data Engineering Portfolio

### Building and Documenting Enterprise-Grade Data Platforms on the Cloud.

This repository serves as the engineering lab for **Higor Cazuza** and **Jana√≠na Cazuza**, two Data Engineers on a journey to master the art of building scalable and reliable data systems.

Here, we will tackle data challenges by designing, implementing, and documenting end-to-end solutions, putting modern data engineering principles into practice.

### üöÄ Our First Mission: Project Lakehouse Foundation (Phase 1)

This repository will house the first major project of our Asymptora journey, corresponding to **Phase 1: The Foundation** of our career development plan. The primary objective is to design and implement a complete, production-ready data pipeline on AWS, showcasing mastery over fundamental data engineering concepts.

#### Planned Architecture

The planned architecture will follow modern, modular principles designed for scalability and maintainability. Our goal is to create a blueprint for robust data ingestion and processing.

**[ ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM TO BE ADDED ONCE DESIGN IS FINALIZED ]**

The core components of the planned architecture are:

1.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The entire AWS infrastructure (VPC, S3 Buckets, EC2, IAM roles) will be defined and managed programmatically using **Terraform**. This ensures a completely automated and reproducible environment.
2.  **Containerized Logic:** Data processing logic, written in **Python** and **SQL**, will be packaged into **Docker** containers. This provides consistency across development and production environments.
3.  **Orchestration:** **Apache Airflow** will be used to schedule and orchestrate the entire workflow, from data ingestion to final transformation, ensuring reliability and clear dependency management.
4.  **Data Lake Storage:** Raw and processed data will be stored in Amazon S3, establishing a scalable and cost-effective data lake foundation.
