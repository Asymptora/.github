## üîç Methodology: A Governed End-to-End Data Lifecycle

Grounded in the modern ELT paradigm, we ensure a clear separation of concerns and maximize both efficiency and data integrity. Each phase emphasizes automation, governance, and domain-specific best practices.

| Phase                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Data Engineering & Platform Foundation**      | Architect and maintain scalable, event-driven pipelines (Airflow + AWS) to ingest high-volume clicks, orders, and fulfillment events into a central warehouse (AWS Redshift). Emphasis on integrity, observability, and serverless automation.                                                 |
| **2. Analytics Engineering & Business Enablement** | Apply advanced **dbt** and **SQL** to transform raw events into governed analytical models‚Äîsessions, orders, deliveries‚Äîdelivering a Single Source of Truth. Build documented, tested, and business-aligned schemas that empower self-service analytical capabilities and strategic decisions. |

## üìö Domain Case Studies

Each project illustrates our methodology in action, with detailed READMEs and replayable code.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Case Study: Conversion Funnel & Cohort Analysis</strong></summary>
  <br/>
  **Objective:** Optimize checkout performance by structuring clickstream and order events into a dimensional star schema.
  - **Data Engineering (Jana√≠na):** Built incremental Airflow pipelines to ingest session and order logs from S3 to Redshift.
  - **Analytics Engineering (Higor):** Developed **dbt** models (`stg_sessions`, `fct_orders`, `dim_customer`) with rigorous tests for funnel drop-offs and cohort retention metrics.
  **Outcome:** Improved conversion by 12% in 4 weeks through targeted UX experiments.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Case Study: Delivery Performance & Demand Forecasting</strong></summary>
  <br/>
  **Objective:** Enhance logistics efficiency by modeling fulfillment events and predicting daily SKU demand.
  - **Data Engineering (Jana√≠na):** Orchestrated end-to-end AWS Lambda and Airflow workflows to collect and enrich tracking events.
  - **Analytics Engineering (Higor):** Implemented a **dbt** pipeline (`int_fulfillment`, `fct_forecast`) integrating Great Expectations for SLA tests and producing feature tables for machine learning.
  **Outcome:** Reduced late delivery rate by 18% and improved inventory planning accuracy by 22%.
